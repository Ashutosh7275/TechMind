          of Communication Design or Icograda, which was formerly an initialism for International Council of Graphic

          was founded in London in 1963 and celebrated its 50th anniversary on 27 April 2013.[4][5] It is a non-profit,
          non-partisan, "member-based network of independent organisations and stakeholders working within the
          multidisciplinary scope of design."[4]

          The membership of the Council is composed of national entities including professional design associations,
          design promotion bodies and design education institutions. Design media are affiliated through the
          International Design Media Network (IDMN).[4].

        <p class="lead">The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to
          modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on
          mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.[1] Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler
          theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to
          communicate instructions.

          The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945.[2] The
          first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD
          thesis.[3] The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956
          (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM..

        <p class="lead">It is still used, just not for mainspace articles. I don't have a link to an example, but I have
          seen it used in the Talk pages of some templates, where the Talk page is divided into "=Usage=" and
          "=Discussion=", so that when a person clicks on the "+" to start a new discussion section, it gets put under
          the super-section "=Discussion=". It also of course is bigger, which someone might want for some purpose;
          there are undoubtedly uses that aren't thought of in this discussion here which may be used now or in the
          future. It might, for example, diminish errors to have sections require two characters "==" rather than one
          "=" for accidents. —Centrx→talk • 23:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC).
